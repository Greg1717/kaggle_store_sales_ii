This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Load Packages and Data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tsibble)
library(fable)
library(fpp3)
train = read_csv('./data/train.csv')
test = read_csv('./data/test.csv')
```


# EDA
```{r}
str(train)
```
Convert to tsibble:
```{r}
train <- tsibble(train, index = date, key = c(store_nbr, family))
str(train)
```

```{r}
summary(train)
```
```{r}
table(train$family)
```

## Plot
### Aggregate Sales and Review TS
```{r}
train |>
  summarise(sales = sum(sales)) |>
  autoplot(.vars = sales) +
  labs(title = "Sales",
       subtitle = "Consolidated",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Sales")
```

### Decompose
```{r}
train_consolidated <- 
  train |>
  summarise(sales = sum(sales)) |>
  fill_gaps(sales = 0)




dcmp <- train_consolidated |>
  model(stl = STL(sales))

components(dcmp) |>
  autoplot()

is.ts(train_consolidated)
is.ts(us_employment)
is_tsibble(us_employment)
frequency(us_employment)
frequency(train_consolidated)
us_employment

  # model(STL(sales)) |>
  # components()
```
